# GraphEdgeForce
**This is a little experiment that came to my mind when I was thinking about how various graph layout algorithms might work.**

Each edge has a target-length assigned. Deviation from that cause expanding or contracting forces onto the two nodes it is incident with.

- clicking on a node or edge deletes it
- clicking on white space creates a new node
- mousedown on one node and mouseup on another one creates a new edge between the two
- while holding shift you can drag nodes
- the target length for each edge can be changed in the little input-fields, a change is confirmed with enter or once the input-field has been left with tab

Some more info appears when leaving the mouse on the buttons.

Feel free to send me cool setups as screenshots or graphml-files, I'll include them in the examples :smiley:
